# ATM_Machine
The Java ATM Machine Program is a comprehensive software program that emulates the functionalities of a genuine Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Developed using Java programming language.
this project facilitates secure and user-friendly banking transactions through an interactive interface. Users can engage in operations such as account access, balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, fund deposits, PIN changes, and more, replicating real-world financial interactions within a controlled environment.

Objective:
Develop a comprehensive Java-based ATM simulation system, encompassing core functionality through the ATM class and user interactions via the AtmOperationImpl implementation, offering a realistic experience for managing balances, transactions, and statements.

features:
- Comments
- Authentication
- User Input Validation
- User Experience
- Loop Logic:
- Exception Handling

Requirements:
-  java Development Kit (JDK)
-  Java Compiler
-  Version Control (Optional)

Classes:

ATM Class (Java): This Java program defines an ATM class managing balance, deposit, and withdrawal amounts. With getter and setter methods, it encapsulates account data and forms the foundation for an ATM simulation.

ATM Operation Implementation (Java): In this Java program, the AtmOperationImpl class implements the AtmOperationInterf interface, offering features for viewing balance, making secure withdrawals and deposits, and viewing mini statements. It uses an instance of the ATM class and a HashMap to maintain transaction records.

ATM Operation Interface (Java): This Java interface, AtmOperationInterf, outlines the contract for ATM operations such as viewing balance, withdrawing, depositing, and viewing mini statements, providing a consistent structure for implementing classes.

Main ATM Simulation (Java): The MainClass program serves as an entry point for an ATM simulation. It verifies user authentication, offers a menu-driven interface for operations, and interacts with the user through the AtmOperationInterf methods for a complete ATM experience.

Authentication: You have implemented basic authentication using ATM number and PIN, which is a good start. However, in a real-world scenario, you might want to enhance the security of authentication mechanisms.

User Input Validation: While your code prompts users for input, it's important to validate the input to prevent unexpected behavior or errors. For example, validating whether the input is a valid number or not.
